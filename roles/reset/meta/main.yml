    short_description: Remove node from cluster
    description:
      - Remove the node from the cluster.
      - It's recommended to set the C(joined_control_plane_node) variable.
      - When not set, the node will not be removed from the API server.
      - In other words, running C(kubectl get nodes) will show the removed node with I(Unknown) status.
